//Some values are base values and changed by the in-game skill. The formula for reflex and accuracy
//is basevalue/skill. So if you give a base reflex of 500ms, a nightmare bot will have a reaction time of
//100ms. Other values, like turnspeed_combat (higher == faster), are multiplied by the skill number.

//Note also that depending on if the bot and the enemy are moving at the same time, the degrees the bot
//aims off by can be greater than the maximum accuracy value. So if the bot and its enemy are both flying
//through the air and accuracy is at 20, the bot could easily aim off by 25 degrees instead. That is,
//unless perfectaim is 1. In this case the bot will aim perfectly at all times (as the name indicates).

	Ooh, someone's getting awfully angry, aren't they?
	Are all Jedi as weak as Rosh? Or just Katarn's personal brats?
	Perhaps you too will learn to serve Tavion.
	Finish him, Jedi!
	Strike him down! Give in to your anger!
	Well done, Jedi! You have become one of us!
